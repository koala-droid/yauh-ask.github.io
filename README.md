## Greetings!

To keep it creative, I started a new journey of learning coding!

### Markdown

Markdown is my first path in coding thanks to the greatest Evan from HYF! ðŸ¥š

- I am Yauheniya or Eugenie or female version of the flemish band [Yevgueni](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oP5ig6-_Jk)!

> I am native Russian, coming from Belarus, travelling around the world, speaking a bunch of languages. 

* Now it is time to learn a new one, the greatest one - of the programming!



For more details meet me in Slack.
